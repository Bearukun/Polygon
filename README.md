# Week 9-14 Project part 1
This period will be mostly project, with sprints and development of the solution for Polygon.

I have added a [file on gitignore](gitignore.md), as many had problems with it.

Useful ressources:

- [Formal project assignment part 1](https://github.com/CphBusCosSem2/week9-14-Project-part-1/blob/master/Project%20Assignment%20Part%201%20fall%202016.md)
- [Semester plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zSEZmKhArmABz01OYuT6r_hhprzMmqxqNV_IkqIMocY/edit?pref=2&pli=1#gid=0) Including when there are scrum meetings and reviews, as well as mandatory presence.

There are some topics which will be addressed in the project period. Basically they are best understood when you have a larger system to keep track of.

- Week 10: there will be a few days on how to write automated tests for part of your program
- Week 11: there will a day on how to handle all the SQL exceptions in a good manner
- Week 12: there will be a day on how to refactor your program into a better style
- Week 13: there will be two days where we talk about overall architecture and code documentation

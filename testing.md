# Testing
## Monday October 31.

As preparation for Monday, you should view the following on Lynda:
<https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Welcome/124398/137955-4.html>. 
It is nearly two hours, so remember to set some time aside.

There are a few sections which can be skipped:

- There is a section on how to do it in Eclipse - we use Netbeans, so that is different for us.
- Section 5 "Additional topics" can be skipped
